# Results — ProjetoSaudeV2

## 1. Overview
After integrating all main components — **Node-RED**, **SQLite**, and **uibuilder** — the system operated successfully as a fully local and real-time monitoring platform for patient vital signs.

The simulation, processing, and visualization workflow performed efficiently without requiring any external APIs or network dependencies.

## 2. System Performance
- **Real-time updates:** Data generated by the `simulate_data_pacient` node was instantly reflected on the uibuilder dashboard.  
- **Database storage:** All readings were properly formatted by `convert_payload_to_insert_sqllite` and inserted into the **SQLite (`db_saude`)** database without delay.  
- **Local communication:** Node-RED managed all data routing internally through message flows.  
- **Frontend behavior:** The uibuilder interface displayed patient data dynamically, updating automatically with each new simulation cycle.
