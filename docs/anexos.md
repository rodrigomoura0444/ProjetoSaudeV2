# ProjetoSaudeV2 — Results

## 1. Overview
After integrating the **Python**, **Node-RED**, **SQLite**, and **uibuilder** modules, the system operated successfully as a fully local, real-time monitoring platform for patient vital signs.  
All processes — simulation, data storage, and visualization — were executed without the need for external APIs.

## 2. System Performance

- **Real-time updates:** Data generated by the Node-RED simulation node (`simulate_data_pacient`) appeared instantly on the uibuilder dashboard.  
- **Database storage:** All readings were correctly formatted by the `convert_payload_to_insert_sqllite` node and stored in the **SQLite** database (`db_saude`).  
- **Local communication:** Node-RED managed all internal message routing without requiring HTTP endpoints.  
- **Web interface:** The dashboard displayed multiple patients simultaneously, updating automatically with every new simulation cycle.

## 5. Evaluation
The system achieved all predefined objectives:  
- Complete integration of **simulation**, **data processing**, **storage**, and **visualization**.  
- Reliable real-time performance across multiple simulation cycles.  
- Modular and low-code design suitable for educational and research purposes.  
- Stable and efficient operation in a fully local environment.
