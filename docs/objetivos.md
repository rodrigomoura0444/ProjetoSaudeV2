# Objectives — ProjetoSaudeV2

## 1. Overview
**ProjetoSaudeV2** is designed to develop an intelligent and modular **patient monitoring system**, combining **Node-RED**, **SQLite**, and **uibuilder** into a unified and interactive platform.

The system simulates, processes, stores, and visualizes vital signs — including heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and blood pressure — for multiple patients in real time, using a fully local architecture without external APIs.

---

## 2. General Objectives
- Build a **real-time health monitoring platform** based entirely on local and open-source tools.  
- Integrate **automation**, **data processing**, and **visualization** within a single, cohesive workflow.  
- Demonstrate how **Node-RED** serves as the central logic layer connecting simulation, storage, and visualization components.

---

## 3. Specific Objectives
- Configure **Node-RED** to simulate, process, and store patient data in **SQLite (`db_saude`)**.  
- Create a **responsive and dynamic dashboard** using **uibuilder** for live data visualization.  
- Ensure all components communicate locally, without dependence on external APIs or internet access.  
- Provide structured and professional documentation using **MkDocs**.  
- Implement data validation and real-time display through **debug** and **uibuilder** nodes.

## 4. Summary
**ProjetoSaudeV2** demonstrates how low-code automation and software integration can be applied to healthcare technology.  
It establishes a **modern**, **reliable**, and **educational** prototype for real-time patient monitoring, combining efficiency and accessibility in a fully local ecosystem.
